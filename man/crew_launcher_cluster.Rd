}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Name of the launcher.}

\item{seconds_interval}{Number of seconds between
polling intervals waiting for certain internal
synchronous operations to complete,
such as checking \code{mirai::status()}.}

\item{seconds_timeout}{Number of seconds until timing
out while waiting for certain synchronous operations to complete,
such as checking \code{mirai::status()}.}

\item{seconds_launch}{Seconds of startup time to allow.
A worker is unconditionally assumed to be alive
from the moment of its launch until \code{seconds_launch} seconds later.
After \code{seconds_launch} seconds, the worker is only
considered alive if it is actively connected to its assign websocket.}

\item{seconds_idle}{Maximum number of seconds that a worker can idle
since the completion of the last task. If exceeded, the worker exits.
But the timer does not launch until \code{tasks_timers} tasks
have completed.
See the \code{idletime} argument of \code{mirai::daemon()}. \code{crew} does not
excel with perfectly transient workers because it does not micromanage
the assignment of tasks to workers, so please allow enough idle
time for a new worker to be delegated a new task.}

\item{seconds_wall}{Soft wall time in seconds.
The timer does not launch until \code{tasks_timers} tasks
have completed.
See the \code{walltime} argument of \code{mirai::daemon()}.}

\item{tasks_max}{Maximum number of tasks that a worker will do before
exiting. See the \code{maxtasks} argument of \code{mirai::daemon()}.
\code{crew} does not
excel with perfectly transient workers because it does not micromanage
the assignment of tasks to workers, it is recommended to set
\code{tasks_max} to a value greater than 1.}

\item{tasks_timers}{Number of tasks to do before activating
the timers for \code{seconds_idle} and \code{seconds_wall}.
See the \code{timerstart} argument of \code{mirai::daemon()}.}

\item{reset_globals}{\code{TRUE} to reset global environment
variables between tasks, \code{FALSE} to leave them alone.}

\item{reset_packages}{\code{TRUE} to unload any packages loaded during
a task (runs between each task), \code{FALSE} to leave packages alone.}

\item{reset_options}{\code{TRUE} to reset global options to their original
state between each task, \code{FALSE} otherwise. It is recommended to
only set \code{reset_options = TRUE} if \code{reset_packages} is also \code{TRUE}
because packages sometimes rely on options they set at loading time.}

\item{garbage_collection}{\code{TRUE} to run garbage collection between
tasks, \code{FALSE} to skip.}

\item{launch_max}{Positive integer of length 1, maximum allowed
consecutive launch attempts which do not complete any tasks.
Enforced on a worker-by-worker basis.
The futile launch count resets to back 0
for each worker that completes a task.
It is recommended to set \code{launch_max} above 0
because sometimes workers are unproductive under perfectly ordinary
circumstances. But \code{launch_max} should still be small enough
to detect errors in the underlying platform.}

\item{tls}{A TLS configuration object from \code{\link[crew:crew_tls]{crew_tls()}}.}

\item{r_arguments}{Optional character vector of command line arguments
to pass to R when starting a worker. Example:
\code{r_arguments = c("--vanilla", "--max-connections=32")}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical, whether to see console output and error messages
when submitting worker.}

\item{command_submit}{Character of length 1,
file path to the executable to submit a worker job.}

\item{command_terminate}{Character of length 1,
file path to the executable to terminate a worker job.
Set to \code{""} to skip manually terminating the worker.
Unless there is an issue with the platform,
the job should still exit thanks to the NNG-powered network programming
capabilities of \code{mirai}. Still, if you set \code{command_terminate = ""},
you are assuming extra responsibility for manually monitoring
your jobs on the cluster and manually terminating jobs as appropriate.}

\item{command_delete}{Deprecated on 2024-01-08 (version 0.1.4.9001).
Use \code{command_terminate} instead.}

\item{script_directory}{Character of length 1, directory path to the
job scripts. Just before each job submission, a job script
is created in this folder. Script base names are unique to each
launcher and worker, and the launcher deletes the script when the
worker is manually terminated. \code{tempdir()} is the default, but it
might not work for some systems.
\code{tools::R_user_dir("crew.cluster", which = "cache")}
is another reasonable choice.}

\item{script_lines}{Optional character vector of additional lines to be
added to the job script just after the more common flags.
An example would be \code{script_lines = "module load R"} if your cluster
supports R through an environment module.}
